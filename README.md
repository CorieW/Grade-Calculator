# Info
A simple calculator to calculate overall grades. Specific for Northumbria University right now.

# Todo
- Add format creation so that filling out details is further specified. Users should be able to create formats already configured for modules/assessment, with prior established values for things like weighings, max marks, and module/assessment names.
- Format search at root path.
- Grade view toggle btn for tablet/phone views.
- Improve grade view for tablet/phone (at least add labels perhaps?).
- Improve text, input, and button scaling for other views (better responsiveness).
- Page icon.
- When there are multiple pages, be sure to improve page titles.
- Ensure that each component's SCSS is not too specific. Instead, a page should specify things like the width of it's components, components should just be sure to be flexible for reuse.
